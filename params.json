{"name":"Textgallery","tagline":"A no-dependency slideshow for quotes and other text","body":"textgallery.js\r\n==============\r\n\r\nOne morning, one may wake up to a requirement for using text in a slideshow, \r\nlike quotes about how great your website is or inspiring passages from ancient\r\ntexts. \r\n\r\nMost carousel plugins work best with images, so here's one that works best with\r\nlines of text. Hooray!\r\n\r\nHighlights\r\n----------\r\n- No dependencies[\\*](#requirements)\r\n- Lightweight\r\n- Selectable text\r\n- Slick test transitions\r\n- Basic, easy-to-overwrite CSS\r\n- Comes with a test suite if you want to extend or modify the source\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"requirements\">jQuery Not Required</a>\r\nBut you will need ES5, which should be pretty standard by now. Sorry if that\r\ndoesn't work for you.\r\n\r\nFull browser compatability table coming soon.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTextgallery works like a standard image gallery, with the addition of the notion\r\nof **blinds**.\r\n\r\nA parent container holds one or more slides. Each slide contains one or more\r\n**blinds**. Think of a blind as a line of text. You'll need to figure out a way\r\nto manage line breaks to work with your design.\r\n\r\nHere's the sample DOM structure that textgallery works with.\r\n\r\n    <div id=\"container\">\r\n        <div class=\"slide\">\r\n            <div class=\"blind\">Winter is coming</div>\r\n            <div class=\"blind\">- Eddard Stark</div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"slide\">\r\n            <div class=\"blind\">In the game of thrones,</div>\r\n            <div class=\"blind\">you win or you die.</div>\r\n            <div class=\"blind\">- Cersei Lannister</div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"slide\">\r\n            <div class=\"blind\">All these quotes and more</div>\r\n            <div class=\"blind\">available for a limited time only!</div>\r\n            <div class=\"blind\"><a href=\"google.com\">Click here for more</a></div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\nJust initialize the Gallery constructor like so: \r\n\r\n    var gallery = new Gallery(document.getElementById('container'))\r\n    gallery.play() // start from the beginning\r\n    gallery.play(2) // start playing from the slide at index 2\r\n    gallery.pause() // pause the animation at the current slide and blind\r\n    gallery.play() // resume playing from where you left off\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**Coming Soon.**\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
